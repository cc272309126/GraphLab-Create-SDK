GraphLab Create SDK
===================

The GraphLab Create SDK aims to provide 3rd party extensibility to GraphLab
Create. The SDK provides:

- A really simple C++ to GraphLab Create to Python FFI interface.
- High level native access to the GraphLab Create datastructures (SArray, SFrame and SGraph)
- It also provides a way for certain SFrame / SGraph Python operators which
  take functions (like SArray.apply, SFrame.apply or SGraph.triple_apply) to
  use native functions instead of Python functions.

Minimum Requirements
--------------------
*Linux*:

- GraphLab Create >= 1.6.1 installation
- gcc 4.8 and above

*Mac*:

- GraphLab Create >= 1.1 installation
- XCode 6.1 Command Line Tools. (Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.54))

The sdk also depends on boost 1.55 or above (headers only). We've included a subset of dependent boost 1.56 header files under boost/.
